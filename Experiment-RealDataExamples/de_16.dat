Roles Classification  
Chemical Role(s):	environmental contaminant
Any minor or unwanted substance introduced into the environment that can have undesired effects.
Biological Role(s):	EC 3.1.4.* (phosphoric diester hydrolase) inhibitor
An EC 3.1.* (ester hydrolase) inhibitor that interferes with the action of a phosphoric diester hydrolase (EC 3.1.4.*).
mouse metabolite
Any mammalian metabolite produced during a metabolic reaction in a mouse (Mus musculus).
EC 2.7.11.1 (non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase) inhibitor
An EC 2.7.11.* (protein-serine/threonine kinase) inhibitor that interferes with the action of non-specific serine/threonine protein kinase (EC 2.7.11.1), a kinase enzyme involved in phosphorylation of hydroxy group of serine or threonine.
ryanodine receptor agonist
A ryanodine receptor modulator which activates the receptor. Ryanodine receptors (RyRs) act as selective ion channels, modulating the release of calcium. Activating the receptors causes the release of calcium, so depleting internal calcium and ultimately preventing further muscle contraction.
fungal metabolite
Any eukaryotic metabolite produced during a metabolic reaction in fungi, the kingdom that includes microorganisms such as the yeasts and moulds.
adenosine A2A receptor antagonist
An antagonist at the A2A receptor.
food additive
Any substance which is added to food to preserve or enhance its flavour and/or appearance.
adenosine receptor antagonist
An antagonist at any adenosine receptor.
plant metabolite
Any eukaryotic metabolite produced during a metabolic reaction in plants, the kingdom that include flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms.
human blood serum metabolite
Any metabolite (endogenous or exogenous) found in human blood serum samples.
xenobiotic
A xenobiotic (Greek, xenos "foreign"; bios "life") is a compound that is foreign to a living organism. Principal xenobiotics include: drugs, carcinogens and various compounds that have been introduced into the environment by artificial means.
ryanodine receptor modulator 

mutagen
An agent that increases the frequency of mutations above the normal background level, usually by interacting directly with DNA and causing it damage, including base substitution.
metabolite
Any intermediate or product resulting from metabolism. The term 'metabolite' subsumes the classes commonly known as primary and secondary metabolites.
(via alkaloid )
Application(s):	psychotropic drug
A loosely defined grouping of drugs that have effects on psychological function.
diuretic
An agent that promotes the excretion of urine through its effects on kidney function.
food additive
Any substance which is added to food to preserve or enhance its flavour and/or appearance.
adjuvant
Any pharmacological or immunological agent that modifies the effect of other agents such as drugs or vaccines while having few if any direct effects when given by itself.
central nervous system stimulant
Any drug that enhances the activity of the central nervous system.
